# Hobbies

I windsurf recreationally and am a member of the [Windsurfing Club Hamburg][WCH]. I am a certified [DSV][dsv] trainer since 2024.

I play piano, blues harp, and guitar at an amateur level. I also like playing [AoE II][aoe].

I use [GoodReads][goodreads] to keep track of books I read/listen to and [Komoot][Komoot] to plan cycling, trekking, and running trips.
