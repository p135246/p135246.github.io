# Software

Before attending university, I programmed on PC in *[Object Pascal][object-pascal]* (*[Delphi][delphi]*) and on 8-bit *[Atmel][atmel]* microchips in *[assembler][avr-asm]* for fun.
I switched to *[Linux][linux]* early on and have been a power user since then.

During my studies, I learned *[Wolfram Mathematica][mathematica]*, which has become my favorite tool for computational tasks of any kind.
I was also interested in languages like *[Haskell][haskell]* and *[Prolog][prolog]*.

During my first postdoc, I learned to touch type (see my [TypeRacer][typeracer]) and became a committed *[Neovim][neovim]* user, even contributing to some plugins in *[Lua][lua]*.

After that, I worked as a software engineer on large-scale distributed systems, picking up full stack engineering (*[Go][go]*, *[PostgreSQL][postgresql]*/*[Oracle][oracle]*, *[React][react]*) and a bit of DevOps (*[Kubernetes][kubernetes]*, *[Datadog][datadog]*, *[Nix][nix]*, *[Azure][azure]*).
I wrote all the production code in *Neovim*, had a keyboard-centric system running all tools in the CLI, and organized myself using *[vimwiki][vimwiki]*.

I then moved into research software engineering at the *[Wolfram Institute][wolfram-institute]* where I decided to drop my customized environment and go with *Apple* products and *macOS* with the default settings.
It was hard to drop the nerdy identity but eventually a big relief, as I gained freedom and more time to research and explore without thinking of a workflow.

I still use *Neovim* for concentrated *[LaTeX][latex]* writing (*[VimTeX][vimtex]* is unbeatable) and for quick edits (often with the AI plugin *[CodeCompanion][codecompanion]*), but otherwise I center my work around *[VS Code][vscode]* with *[GitHub Copilot][github-copilot]* and *[Claude Code][claude-code]*, and *[Wolfram Notebooks][wolfram-notebooks]*.

The notebooks are especially great for multimodal research.
Another great tool that complements notebooks for organizational tasks is *[start.me][startme]*, allowing me to depart from *vimwiki* completely.

That said, if I ever went back to production software engineering, I would happily return to the *Neovim* + *vimwiki* + CLI setup.
