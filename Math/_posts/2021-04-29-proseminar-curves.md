# Proseminar on geometry of curves

In the summer semester of 2021, I conducted a proseminar on the geometry of curves at the [University of Hamburg][UHH] for bachelor’s students.
* Here is the detailed [plan of talks][pdf-talks] based on available literature (on [Springer Link][SpringerLink] and in the [library][UHHBib]).
* Here is my [talk][pdf-fary-milnor] about the Fáry-Milnor theorem. Additionally, it contains a sketch of a proof that there are no non-trivial smooth knots in dimensions other than 3, and a sketch of a sequence of moves that transform the trefoil knot from its torus-knot form to its bridge-number-minimizing form.
