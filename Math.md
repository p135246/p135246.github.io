# Math

I have a PhD in mathematics.
Have a look at my [academic CV][CV] and [arXiv preprints][arXiv].

My background is in *differential geometry* and *mathematical physics*.
I specialize in the following areas:

* Symplectic Geometry
* Chern-Simons Theory
* String Topology

My PhD research was on *chain models of string topology coming from symplectic geometry* (see my [PhD thesis][PhD] and [2022 research plan][RP]).
I worked with the so called *Chern-Simons Maurer-Cartan element* that was later defined [here][KE].
I approached the topic algebraically and gained hands-on experience with the following topics:

* Deformation theory of IBL-infinity algebras
* Sullivan and Poincaré duality models
* Hochschild and cyclic homology
* BV formalism
* Operads

I would like to do research in the following topics as well:

* String field theory and applications of higher algebra in physics.
* Classical and quantum integrability, quantization, semi-classical physics.
* Spinning tops and other concrete Hamiltonian systems.

## Projects

* [PhD thesis][PhD] and [slides][PhDDefence] from defence.
* [Proseminar on geometry of curves][proseminar-on-curves].
* [Mathematica notebook][IBL] implementing the canonical IBL algebra on cyclic words (defined [here][CFL]).
* [Mathematica notebook][CR3BP] (and library) demonstrating the search for trajectories with prescribed itineraries near Lyapunov orbits in the 3-body problem.
* Slides from my talks on chain models of string topology coming from symplectic geometry (Berlin, winter 2021).
* Notes from a summer preparatory course for master's students of mathematical physics (Hamburg, summer 2023).

## Links

* I am active on [StackExchange][SE].
* [Here][startme] I collect links to seminars, lectures, and events I attend.
