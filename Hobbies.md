# Hobbies

I windsurf recreationally and am a member of the [Windsurfing Club Hamburg][WCH]. Since 2024 I am a certified DSV trainer at the basic level.

I play piano, guitar, and blues harp at an amateur level.

I use [GoodReads][goodreads] to keep track of books I read/listen to and [Komoot][Komoot] to plan cycling, trekking, and running trips.
