# How to share iPad screen in BigBlueButton on Linux PC using Android phone

I will explain how to share the screen of an [iPad Pro][iPad] (I) in a [BigBlueButton][BBB] session (BBB) using only a Linux PC (L) and an Android Phone (A).

Note that it is also possible to stream live handwriting to BBB using a [digitizer board][Wacom]
or a simple [document camera][Kamera] connected to (L).
In the first case, one can use the whiteboard app [Xournal][Xournal] on (L) to save the notes in the form of a PDF afterwards.

I encountered the following problems while trying to share the screen of (I) in (BBB):
1. Although BBB offers a collaborative whiteboard, it is currently not possible to download it together with the writing in the end.
2. Although it is possible to join a BBB session from (I), it is currently not possible to share the screen.
3. One can currently share the screen of (I) only in the following two scenarios: either via AirPlay to machines running an AirPlay receiver which are connected to the same ''friendly'' WiFi network (Eduroam does not work), or to a Mac via cable.

## Prerequisities

1. Install [scrcpy][scrcpy] on (L).
2. Install [AirReceiver][AirReceiver] on (A). This is a commercial product, which currently costs 3â‚¬.
3. Allow USB-debugging in the developer's options of (A).
 
## Steps

1. Create a WiFi mobile hotspot on (A) and connect to it with (I).
2. Connect (A) to (L) via USB and switch the connection type on (A) to *USB-tethering* (also disable all sounds and notifications or better put it in the plane mode).
3. Run *AirReceiver* on (A), click share screen on (I), and select (A) as the target. 
   The screen of (A) should now mirror the screen of (I).
5. Run *scrcpy* on (L), so that a window with the screen of (A) appears. This screen can be now streamed in BBB (if you are using a tiling manager, put the BBB and scrpy window on the the same virtual desktop and switch to the monocycle mode). 

## Example

* (A): *Samsung A71* with screen resolution 2400x1080 in the horizontal position with the bottom part to the rigt.
* (I): *iPad Pro 12.9'* with screen resolution 2732x2048.
* Commands to start *scrcpy*:
	```
	% iPad in portrait position
	scrcpy --lock-video-orientation=1 -w --disable-screensaver -S --crop 1080:902:0:794

	% iPad in landscape position
	scrcpy --lock-video-orientation=1 -w --disable-screensaver -S --crop 1080:1680:0:400
	```
Here `--lock-video-orientation=1` assures that the screen of (A) is mirrored horizontally independently of its rotation, `-w` prevents (A) from falling asleep, `-S` turns off the screen of (A), `--crop 1080:902:0:794` crops the mirrored window.

## Other ideas

* Create a virtual video device using [v4l2loopback][v4l2loopback] or [akvcam][akvcam] and redirect the *scrcpy* window there.
* Run a free Airplay server [RPiPlay][RPiPlay] or [shairplay][shairplay] on (L) directly and bypass `scrcpy` and `AirReceiver`. It should work if (A) is connected via USB tethering but needs to be properly configured.
  In case that it doesn't work, get an USB WiFi adapter and create a hotspot on (L).
* Buy an HDMI/USB-A video grabber for (L) and an USB-C/HDMI adapter for (I) to connect them, bypass (A) completely. However, the quality will depend on the grabber and the HDMI bandwidth.
* There is a [BBB app][BBBapp] for Android and iOS under development which will hopefully implement the screen sharing.
