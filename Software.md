# Software

I started programming long before university, first in *[Pascal][pascal]* and *[Object Pascal][object-pascal]* in *[Delphi][delphi]* on PC, and later in *[assembler][avr-asm]* on 8-bit *[Atmel AVR][atmel]* microcontrollers.
I switched to *[Linux][linux]* early on, grew into a power user, and picked up some admin-level skills. After a few initial experiments, I stayed loyal to *[openSUSE][opensuse]*.

During my studies, I discovered *[Wolfram Mathematica][mathematica]*, which quickly became my favorite tool for computational work of any kind.
Along the way, I also explored languages like *[Prolog][prolog]* and *[Haskell][haskell]*.

During my first postdoc, I learned to touch type (see my [TypeRacer][typeracer]) and became a committed *[Neovim][neovim]* user, even contributing to some plugins in *[Lua][lua]*.

After that, I worked as a software engineer on large-scale distributed systems for a while, picking up full stack engineering (*[Go][go]*, *[PostgreSQL][postgresql]*/*[Oracle][oracle]*, *[React][react]*) and some DevOps tooling (*[Kubernetes][kubernetes]*, *[Datadog][datadog]*, *[Nix][nix]*, *[Azure][azure]*).
I wrote all production code in *Neovim*—without exception—ran a keyboard-centric CLI workflow, and organized everything through *[vimwiki][vimwiki]*.

When I moved into research software engineering at the *[Wolfram Institute][wolfram-institute]*, I made a deliberate choice to drop my customized environment and adopt *Apple* products and *macOS* with their default settings.
Letting go of the nerdy identity was surprisingly difficult, but ultimately a relief.
I gained more time and mental space to research and explore what matters without thinking about workflows or sharpening tools.

I still use *Neovim* for focused *[LaTeX][latex]* writing (*[VimTeX][vimtex]* remains unmatched) and for quick edits (often with the *[CodeCompanion][codecompanion]* AI plugin), but my main workflow now centers on *[VS Code][vscode]* with *[GitHub Copilot][github-copilot]* and *[Claude Code][claude-code]*. Another great tool is *[Wolfram Notebooks][wolfram-notebooks]*, which are especially powerful for multimodal research and explorations. For organizational tasks I now use *[start.me][startme]* and the default Apple tools, which allowed me to depart from *vimwiki* completely.

That said, if I ever returned to production software engineering, I would happily go back to the *Neovim* + *vimwiki* + CLI setup.
