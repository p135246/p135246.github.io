# IT

I programmed in *Object Pascal* (*Delphi*) and played with 8-bit microchips a lot before attending university.
I have also been a *Linux* user since then.
During my studies, I learned *Wolfram Mathematica* and it has become my favorite tool/language.
After my PhD, I learned to touch type (see [TypeRacer][typeracer]) and became a committed *Vim* (*neovim*) user---that greatly increased my life satisfaction.
I am interested in languages like *Haskell*, but I have also tried *Java*, *C++*, and *Python*.
